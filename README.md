## How to Play

### Objective
Start with **$10,000** and grow your portfolio to **$1,000,000** to graduate!

### Mechanics

**Yield Farming**
- Deposit into 6 different pools with varying APYs (8% - 420%)
- Higher APY = Higher risk of getting rugged
- Yields accumulate every second

**Halving**
- Every 5 minutes, all yields are cut in half
- Plan your strategy around halving cycles!

**RNG Events**
- 🚨 **Rug Pull** - Pool drains completely (15% chance)
- ⚠️ **Exploit** - Pool loses 50%, blocked by Audit (20% chance)
- 🐋 **Whale Dump** - All yields -30% for 60s (25% chance)
- ⛽ **Gas Spike** - Actions cost 3x for 30s (30% chance)
- 🚀 **Pump** - Random pool 2x yields for 30s (10% chance)

**Items**
- 🛡️ **Audit ($500)** - Blocks one exploit attack
- 🏥 **Insurance ($200)** - Reduces whale dump damage by 50%
